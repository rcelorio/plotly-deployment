# Plotly Deployment

## Belly Button Biodiversity Study
### Objective
Create a dynamic dashboard for a panel of study volunteer to visualize demographic information and the navel bacterial data. Volunteers need to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel. The dashboard displays a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteerâ€™s navel. Also, volunteers can visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species in the bubble chart.
